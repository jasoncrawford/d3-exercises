Teaching myself [d3](https://d3js.org) through exercises.

To do (ideas):

* Do something with animated transitions (not just on initial render)
* Use a “brush” to allow user to select a window on a long timeline
* Do something with graphs/networks?
* Something where you can zoom in/out of a hierarchy
* Something with statistics and/or random numbers
